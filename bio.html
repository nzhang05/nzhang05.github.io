        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>I am a Sophomore pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Finance at Tufts University. The<br /> 
            problem-solving and logical aspects of coding are what primarily intrigue me in the field of Computer Science,<br /> 
            as well as my drive to constantly learn. My goal is to be able to combine my technical skills with my passion<br /> 
            for communicating with people.</p>
